# Neurotech-Projects
A collection of neuroscience, mental health and AI projects 
This repository contains all of my own pet projects of me combining the intersection of AI, Neuroscience and Mental health 

## Project 1: First coding project: Basic data analysis in Google Colab 
- created a small dataset representing mental health scores for different patients
- used pandas for data handling
- basic visualization of patient data using matplotlib

## Project 2: Predicting Depression Risk with Machine learning 

### Overview: used public survey data from Kaggle (lifestyle factors, stress levels, work/sleep balance) to build a machine learning model that predicts risk of depression

- Data cleaning, visualization and exploratory data analysis
- feature engineering and preprocessing via Standardscaler
- machine learning classification (Basic logistic regression)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 -score)
- Ethical reflection on the use of AI in Mental health
